warrenshea.github.io is the Sandbox for Warren Shea (Front-end Web Developer). This site is a Sandbox for trying new things and Code Examples.

## Frameworks, Tools

This site is built with [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). The code is version controlled via [GitHub](https://github.com/).

It includes packages including (but not limited to) [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/), [gulp-contact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat), [gulp-jshint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jshint), [gulp-plumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-plumber), [gulp-postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-postcss), [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass), [gulp-uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify).

Tools I use: [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Chrome + Chrome Dev Tools](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [HTML CodeSniffer](http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/) for Accessibility, [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) for Optimization

## Motivation

http://warrenshea.github.io fills a very specific need for my online presence. 

[warrenshea.com](http://www.warrenshea.com) is my professional online portfolio and resume.

[worldofwarren.com](http://www.worldofwarren.com) is my hobby page - to write about the things that bring me joy.

Finally, [warrenshea.github.io](http://warrenshea.github.io) is made to try things out, store useful code, build a custom framework, and possibly keep notes or other things that don't fall into the already defined areas.
